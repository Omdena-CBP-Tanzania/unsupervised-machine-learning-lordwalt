ï»¿# Retail Customer Segmentation
## Objective: 
- Discover and analyze natural customer groupings to inform targeted marketing strategies, product recommendations, and business decisions.

## Dataset
You'll work with a synthetic retail dataset containing:

- Customer demographics (age, income, etc.)
- Purchase history (frequency, monetary value, recency)
- Product category preferences
- Website/app engagement metrics
- Geographic location data

## Project Steps
### 1. Environment Setup & Data Acquisition

- Set up Python environment with necessary libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Get the dataset (This is in the data directory)
- Perform initial data exploration with basic statistics and visualizations

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values through imputation or removal
- Detect and address outliers
- Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding or label encoding)
- Scale/normalize numerical features
- Reduce dimensionality where appropriate

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction

- Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Implement t-SNE for visualization
- Compare results from both techniques

### 4. Clustering Algorithms Implementation

#### K-Means clustering

- Determine optimal k using elbow method and silhouette scores
- Visualize clusters
- Interpret cluster centers


#### Hierarchical clustering

- Try different linkage methods
- Create and interpret dendrograms
- Compare with K-Means results


#### DBSCAN

- Tune epsilon and min_samples parameters
- Identify noise points
- Compare density-based results with centroid-based results


#### Gaussian Mixture Models

- Implement probabilistic clustering
- Analyze cluster probabilities and memberships



### 5. Association Rule Mining

- Apply Apriori algorithm to discover product purchase patterns
- Calculate support, confidence, and lift
- Extract actionable association rules

### 6. Anomaly Detection

- Implement Isolation Forest to detect unusual customer behaviors
- Use One-Class SVM as an alternative method
- Compare anomaly detection results

### 7. Customer Profiling & Visualization

- Create detailed profiles for each discovered segment
- Develop interactive visualizations of clusters
- Generate business insights from each segment

### 8. Model Evaluation

- Calculate internal validation metrics (silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index)
- Perform stability analysis through bootstrapping
- Compare results across different algorithms

### 9. Business Recommendations

- Translate technical findings into actionable business strategies
- Develop targeted marketing approaches for each segment
- Suggest product recommendations based on association rules

## Expected Outcomes
- By completing this project, you should be able to:

    - Preprocess data appropriately for unsupervised learning
    - Apply and compare multiple clustering techniques
    - Extract meaningful patterns from unlabeled data
    - Evaluate clustering quality without ground truth labels
    - Translate technical findings into business insights
    - Present results through effective visualizations
    - Make data-driven recommendations based on discovered patterns

## Project Extensions (Optional)

- Implement semi-supervised techniques
- Deploy a simple recommendation system based on discovered segments
- Create a dashboard for ongoing customer segment monitoring
- Compare results with a supervised classification approach if labels become available
